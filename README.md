"Reflection of Course cs-255 System Analysis and Design"

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project goal was to develop a system that would provide a comprehensive online platform to train drivers. Liam is the owner of the company and provided clear requirements in the interview for the system they wanted us to develop. The features included data accessibility (Cloud-based service), driving packages, user role access, compliance updates (dmv), a user friendly UI and tools for employees and administrators to make reservations, track and log reports and manage user accounts.  

What did you do particularly well?
My knowledge and skill increased with LucidChart. I am able to navigate the many templates and tools to creat an effective diagram (UML diagrams, class diagrams, flow charts, gantt charts). Deciphering client request into effective documentation was another skill I expanded on.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would add more detail into my UML class diagram. THe diagram provides a great starting point for developers who are already familiar with OOP (object oriented programming) and having a comprehensive and details class diagram would be beneifical to everybody involved in the project. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By closely analyzing the interview documentation, I was able to identify key users of the system and the requirements of all stakeholders. Careful and detailed analysis guided me in developing accurate requirements documentation which would aid me in the design stage. Its important to consider the user's needs when designing because ultimatly, user satisfaction aligns with the requirements and its cost effective because you will reduce the likelihood of having to redesign your systems later into the development cycle. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
A clear and accurate analysis of the requirements from the stakeholders as well as detailed designs of the system will make implementation a lot more smooth. The diagrams really helped me visual the systems that would be needed for the DriverPass system to function. I would really focus on designing clear requirements and comprehensive diagrams as it would aid the development process. Clear analysis and designs will alleviate development roadbumps such as schedules and budgets.
